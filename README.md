#Three.js

## What is three.js?

The aim of the project is to create a lightweight 3D library with a very low level of complexity â€” in other words, for dummies. The library provides `<canvas>`, `<svg>`, CSS3D and WebGL renderers.

Three.js is a library that makes WebGL - 3D in the browser - easy to use. While a simple cube in raw WebGL would turn out hundreds of lines of Javascript and shader code, a Three.js equivalent is only a fraction of that.

##Some Basics (Playing God)
ThreeJS and 3D modeling work in a similar capacity to our scientific understanding of the world and visual sight.

#####The Void (Blank Scene)
In the begining there was nothing.  A blank canvas, the void. An empty scene.

Then you add a shape to the scene, a box.

You cannot see the box.  This is because there is no light!

#####Let their be light(Lighting)
You add a light source.  Now there is the ability to see.  However you still see nothing.

#####Fast foward to man(Cameras)
You add a camera or in this metaphor, you.  You need something to interpret the light bounce.  This is the camera. You need a point in space to view the scene from.

####To Summarize....
SCENE > LIGHTS > CAMERA > (A WHOLE BUNCH OF FUNCTIONS) > ACTION!
	


##Required libraries
Pick one:

*	Include the [CDN](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/three.js/)
*	Download from [three.js website](http://threejs.org/)

##Renderers
* **WebGL Render** - (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.

###Very simple three.js program

* **Canvas Render** - displays scenes using the slower 2D context
